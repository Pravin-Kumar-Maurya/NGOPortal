      <h3>They are motivated by helping others</h3>
    <p style="text-align:justify; " class="card-text">Our volunteers do lots of different activities but are united by the same goal: to serve
        humanity. Often people join their local Red Cross or Red Crescent society as a temporary volunteer
        in the wake of a disaster. Many enjoy volunteering so much they stay on—sometimes for many decades.
